The idea for this graph came from a R user group that was held in INSEE. The speaker was presenting [ggplot2](https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2), and as an example he showed the graph I'm presenting here. I found it particularly striking, and so I wanted to duplicate it. By the way, I've been told that activists for coeducation used it for a slideshow in high places...

The data used is the ['EnquÃªte Emploi' survey by INSEE, 2009 version](http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/detail.asp?ref_id=fd-eec09). The variables of interest are quite simple really: gender, age and 'monthly net wage, adjusted for missing answers' (SALRED variable). 

The data used and the R code is in a [github repository](https://github.com/joelgombin/Inegalites).

So, here is the graph:
